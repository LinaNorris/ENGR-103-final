## What does it do?
This is a game for use on a Adafruit Circuit Playground

## Rules:
There are three levels, each level gets increasingly difficult.
First level:
You have to click the chasing light when it gets to the goal LED(the one lit up green). If you click the left button when the chasing light gets to the goal LED, then it will play the beat of the song and light up. You can only miss three times before you have to start over. 
If you get to the end of the level with less than three misses, then you move on to level 2.

Second Level:
You still have to click the chasing light when it gets to the goal LED, but this time you also have to tilt it whichever way the direction LEDs tell you to(located on the bottom of the board).
the directional LEDs are the bottom four LEDs. The top two, when lit up, mean that you need to tilt it up. The bottom two, when lit up, mean that you need to tilt it down.
If you pass this level then you move on to level 3.

Third Level:
The second level, but faster.
